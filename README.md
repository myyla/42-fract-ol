# 42cursus - Fract'ol : 
          Computer Graphics Fractals ðŸ”Ž

## Summary: 
  This project is about creating graphically beautiful fractals.
  
## Foreward:
  The "hydraulic fracturing," is the targeted disruption of geological formations with low permeability by means of injection under high pressure of a fluid to micro-cracking and crack the rock. This fracturing can be performed near the surface or at depth (over 1 km or more than 4 km in the case of shale gas) and from vertical wells, sloped or horizontal.
This relatively old technique (1947), developed for conventional oil deposits, is re- newed by its association with horizontal drilling (developed from 1980). It is the gradual mastery of the economic viability of this association for non-conventional deposits, who guided the recent development of the operation of these: it made available formerly in- accessible resources, or which have been exploited at exorbitant costs and slowly.
It is performed by fracturing the rock by a mechanical "stress" using a fluid injected under high pressure from a surface drilling, to increase the macro porosity and less the micro porosity. The fluid could be the water, a slurry or a technical fluid whose viscosity was adjusted.

This project is not called fractâ€™oil and accordingly has no relation to hydraulic frac- turing.

## Objectives:
  - Create a basic computer graphics project!
  - Use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! 
    This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
  - Use the mathematical notion of complex numbers.
  - Take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.
  - Practice event handling.

## Introduction
  The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. He based it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern remains the same at every scale.
Various natural phenomena â€“ like the romanesco cabbage â€“ have some fractal features.

### <a name="fractal">What is the term fractal?</a>

 - A simple definition of the term "fractal" is a complex geometric shape or pattern that exhibits self-similarity at different scales. In other words, when you zoom in or out on a fractal, you will see similar patterns repeated at various levels of magnification. Fractals have intricate and often beautiful designs and are commonly used in computer graphics and art. They are generated through mathematical algorithms and have applications in various fields, including computer graphics, simulations, and natural landscapes generation.
- Complex picture created using iteration and single formula
  Ex: Mountains - clouds


### <a name="types-fractal">Types of fractals?</a>

- Self similar: those fractals have parts as scaled down version of entire object.
- Self affine: have parts formed with different scaling parameters in different coordinate directions.
- Invarient: formed with non linear transformations.

### <a name="dimenson-fractal">Fractal Dimension?</a> 

 - Fractal dimension is measure of roughness or fragmentation of the object
 - The more jagged is the looking of the object the bigger is the fractal dimension
 - We can calculate fractal Dimension D using some iterative procedures.

### <a name="examples-fractals">Fractal Examples?</a> 

Fractals come in various types, each with its unique characteristics and generation methods. Some of the popular types of fractals include:

- Mandelbrot Set: One of the most famous and iconic fractals, named after mathematician BenoÃ®t B. Mandelbrot. It is created by iterating a simple mathematical equation for each point in the complex plane.

- Julia Set: Closely related to the Mandelbrot Set, the Julia Set is generated using a similar iterative process, but each point in the complex plane is associated with its own complex number, known as the Julia constant.

- Sierpinski Triangle: This is a classic fractal made up of equilateral triangles. It is generated by recursively removing smaller triangles from a larger one, creating a self-replicating pattern.

- Koch Snowflake: The Koch Snowflake is a fractal constructed by iteratively replacing the middle third of each line segment with an equilateral triangle.
   -> each straight line is replaced with four equal sized lines of scaling factor 1/3
   -> fractol dimension : 1.2619

- Fractal Trees: Fractal trees are generated by iteratively branching and subdividing branches into smaller ones, forming intricate tree-like structures with self-similarity.
