# 42cursus - Fract'ol
  Computer Graphics Fractals. 

## Summary: 
  This project is about creating graphically beautiful fractals.
  
## Foreward:
  The "hydraulic fracturing," is the targeted disruption of geological formations with low permeability by means of injection under high pressure of a fluid to micro-cracking and crack the rock. This fracturing can be performed near the surface or at depth (over 1 km or more than 4 km in the case of shale gas) and from vertical wells, sloped or horizontal.
This relatively old technique (1947), developed for conventional oil deposits, is re- newed by its association with horizontal drilling (developed from 1980). It is the gradual mastery of the economic viability of this association for non-conventional deposits, who guided the recent development of the operation of these: it made available formerly in- accessible resources, or which have been exploited at exorbitant costs and slowly.
It is performed by fracturing the rock by a mechanical "stress" using a fluid injected under high pressure from a surface drilling, to increase the macro porosity and less the micro porosity. The fluid could be the water, a slurry or a technical fluid whose viscosity was adjusted.

This project is not called fractâ€™oil and accordingly has no relation to hydraulic frac- turing.

## Objectives:
  - Create a basic computer graphics project!
  - Use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! 
    This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
  - Use the mathematical notion of complex numbers.
  - Take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.
  - Practice event handling.
